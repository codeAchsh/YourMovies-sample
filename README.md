-About this Portfolio
The portfolio I am uploading today was created as the final assignment for an online web design school.
I didn't really understand everything yet, but I created a Wireframe → Mock-up → Prototype and coded it using what I learned. It is a completely original work.
The mp4 video I placed in the slider seems to not display due to its size, it's fine in VScode but when I uploaded it to GitHub it just didn't work.

*If you like it, please send me a work order.
